# InspectingHTTPusingWireShark
As a assignment given in my CA3 project I have to inspect HTTP of BSNL website and retrieve username and password from http. 

Suppose you are network analyst, working in Infotech department of LPU. You have been 
assigned the responsibility of inspecting HTTP Traffic and retrieve Username and password from 
BSNL website, using appropriate tool.

I have used Wireshark to implement above mentioned task.
